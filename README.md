# Chem-Learning-Challenge
Air pollution is a persistent problem of the world, which has been around for a while and will continue to exist in the future. It is a cause of a lot of problems and has extremely adverse effects. For curbing air pollution, its analysis is first necessary. For making predictions about the air quality, domain knowledge is essential, as are data analysis skills. This problem statement tests them all.

## Problem Statement
Participating teams are invited to propose and implement a multiclass classification technique for a given data set of air quality measurements. We expect a well-structured report detailing the approach used for classification and its implementation. Teams would be provided with the training data set to be used. Teams are expected to brainstorm, ideate, experiment, and code classification techniques to get the best results. The goal of this challenge is to create awareness about the applications of data analysis and machine learning in the chemical engineering domain, especially air quality analysis for air pollution control applications among the student community and provide them a platform to showcase their ideas and innovations.
